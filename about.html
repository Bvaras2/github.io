        		<h1>About Sto Rox Code Club</h1>
			
<p> Sto-Rox Coding Club meets each Wednesdays from 4:00-6:00 p.m. in the DigiLab which is in the basement of the Father Ryan Center. Currently the club is walk in and we have room for new members. If you are interested in learning to code or just interested in what coding is stop in and join us. The club is geared toward teenagers. If you are an adult interested in coding or would like to volunteer to help with the coding club, email me for more information. <a href="mailto:brad.ankney2@gmail.com">Click Here To Email Me</a></p>
<p>Currently the club is working with PencilCode and creating some basic programs using CoffeeScript and JavaScript. I would like to get club members to the point of creating basic webpages integrating JavaScript and CoffeeScript programs with HTML and CSS to create dynamic and interactive webpages. As we progress with PencilCode we will see how far we can go. Currently it seems as though club members are interested in using PencilCode and are creating basic programs exploring coding concepts such as variables, nesting, loops, functions and moving around the coordinate plane.</p>
<p>Some of the coding activities coding members have done in the past include using ipads and the Lightning Lab to explore, play and program robots borrowed from the Allegheny Intermediate Unit. Sphero and Ollie robots were well received by the members and the robots were run the max amount of time until recharging became necessary. Students learned how fun robots can be and how programming can be used to do much more with robots than can be done manually. Club members have also been doing game programming on Code.org and most have made the transition from block based JavaScript Coding to actually writing the code. Bitsbox is another coding activity we have tinkered with, one of the high interest coding activities we did was creating a private texting app that could be shared with individuals to create a private chatroom.</p>
<p>Future activities will be based on the interest of the members, community, and the Father Ryan Center. Currently we have hopes of getting an web programming class started and it seems that interest in the PencilCode Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is steering us in that direction. I am currently exploring it further as I develop this website. We will also be hosting Hour of Code activities for Remake Learning Days in May of 2018. Stay tuned for further details. So far it is looking like an evening of introductory coding for beginning/interested adults and a Saturday morning robotics/coding workshop for young folks.</p>
